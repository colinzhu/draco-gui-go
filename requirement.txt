Please create a GUI application in golang which is for users to convert .STL files to .DRC format. Here are the details of the requirement:
1. GUI design:
    1.1. it allows user to select a folder which contains .STL files
    1.2. it has a input field for user to set parameter value, the default value is: '-qp 18 -cl 10'
    1.3. it has a button ('Convert') for users to start the convertsion
    1.4. initial gui window size is 700 x 500 pixel
2. Once the button is click, the program will start the convertsion
    2.1 it invokes a command line application to do the convertion,the command line application will be place in the same folder of the gui application.
    2.2 here is the example linux command to convert one .STL file: "./draco_encoder -i /folder/test.STL -o /folder/drc/test.src -qp 18 -cl 10"
    2.3 '-qp 18 -cl 10' will be replaced with value from gui parameter field
    2.4 for windows system, the command line application will be draco_encoder.exe
    2.5 the generated drc file will be placed in the sub-folder "drc" inside of user selected folder. 
    2.6 it needs to auto create the sub-folder "drc" folder in the user selected folder first, and then convert all the STL files
    2.7 when convertion is completed, show a message, so the user knows it's completed
3. The GUI application can be run in both linux and windows system
